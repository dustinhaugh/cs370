Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
   The initial commit is that of the TreasureHuntGame
   Were were given pseducode to create reinforcement learning that would train a neural network to solve a maze and eventually find a treasure within it.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
   What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
      I believe that computer scientists study algrotithms to create function. In this class we studied algorithms used to create and train  
      neural networks in various ways, and how to apply them.
      
   How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
      Well, first I try to understand the problem and the various ways other scientists have already tried to solve them. In this class I had to learn
      a great deal of information before I was capable of using the technology that already existed. Then, as I become better at using the tools that
      already exist, I develop ways to apply them. Eventually, I may come up with a tool that I can create for others.
      
   What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
      Transparency when it comes to capability, representing what these methods can and cannot do is very important to the end user. For example, 
      OpenAI has developed AI that can hold a conversation, but it's important to be transparent about it's ability to error.
